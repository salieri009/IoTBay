## 3. Maintenance Protocol

1. **Authoring** – Draft in English (`*.en.md`).  
2. **Categorise** – Place under the correct `en/<n_category>/` folder.  
3. **Cross-link** – Reference related docs in the “Related Work” section of each file.  
4. **Translate** (if required) – Drop language-specific copies into `ja/` or `ko/`.  
5. **Log Changes** – Update `DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE_REVIEW.md` when the information architecture changes.

Update cadence:
- Major roadmap/design shifts → immediately
- Execution logs → at project closure
- Reviews → per audit cycle

## 4. Related Resources
- `DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE_REVIEW.md` – historical rationale for the current layout.
- `design plan/en/5_reference/` – assignment brief and any source mandates.
