# Archive Index - IoT Bay Documentation

**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Last Updated**: December 3, 2025  
**Status**: Published  
**Audience**: Documentation Maintainers, Developers seeking historical context

---

## Purpose

This index catalogs all archived documentation in the IoT Bay project. These files are **deprecated** and should **not** be used for current development. They are preserved for:

- **Historical context** - Understanding past decisions and evolution
- **Audit trail** - Tracking project progression and refactoring history
- **Reference** - Occasional lookup of legacy implementation details

> [!WARNING]
> **DO NOT use archived files for current development.** Always refer to the current documentation in sections 1-7.

## How to Find Current Documentation

If you're looking for information from an archived file, use this index to find the **replacement document** that contains current, maintained information.

**Quick Navigation**:
- For current architecture → [2_architecture/](../2_architecture/)
- For current development guides → [4_development/](../4_development/)
- For current testing docs → [5_testing/](../5_testing/)
- For current requirements → [3_requirements/](../3_requirements/)
- For current planning → [6_planning/](../6_planning/)
- For master index → [INDEX.md](../INDEX.md)

## Retention Policy

**Current Policy**: Indefinite retention in `8_archive/` directory

**Rationale**:
- Git history preserves all content
- Archive provides easier access than git blame/log
- Disk space is not a constraint
- Historical context valuable for understanding evolution

**Future Consideration**: 
- After project completion (post-1.0.0), conduct review to identify files for permanent removal
- Candidates for removal: test artifacts, progress trackers, duplicate summaries

---

## Usage Guidelines

### ✅ Good Uses for Archive Files
- Understanding historical design decisions
- Tracking evolution of specific features
- Audit purposes (understanding "why did we do this?")
- Comparative analysis (before/after refactoring)

### ❌ Bad Uses for Archive Files
- Reference for current development (use current docs instead)
- Copy-pasting code examples (may be outdated)
- Following outdated workflows (use current guides)
- Citing in new documentation (link to current docs)
